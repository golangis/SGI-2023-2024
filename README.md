## Projects

### [TP1 - ThreeJS Basics](tp1)

- Our [Scene](/tp1/) depicts a small and cozy kitchen, getting ready for a Sunday roast! We have created various object classes ([MyTable.js](/tp1/MyTable.js), [MyCake.js](/tp1/MyCake.js), [MyCakeStand.js](/tp1/MyCakeStand.js), etc.) many of which are costumizable, meaning, you can input the measures (via the class constructor) and the object will be rendered with the desired characteristics. All specified requirements have been met.

### [TP2 - Scene Graphs and YASF](tp2)

Our scene illustrates an IKEA model bathroom. It includes all of the primitive types, along with LODs that show the hardware store when at the right distance.

### [TP3 - Racing Game](tp3)
- Ready, set, go! Our group has decided to go with a retro theme for the racing game. It includes [powerups](./MyPowerUp.js), [obstacles](./MyObstacle.js) and a [billboard](./MyBillboard.js) that displays the car at all times.
